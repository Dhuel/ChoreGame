Summary:
The goal of this project is to create a "chore game" that my wife and I enjoy and feel motivated to play. As such, I dedicate this project to her.
The premise is that for each room of the house, there are a list of chores worth a certain amount of points. 
Whoever gets the most points after a week gets a treat. 

Goal:
Create mobile app using Visual studio 2022 Maui that will allow us to keep track of chores and points in a fun/easy way.

Data:
Plan to use AWS Db to store and handle daata.

Step 1 - Create working baseline:
Install Visual studio
Set up Maui Project
Connect to AWS Db (Pull and Push Data)
